# INTERNET-BANKING-SYSTEM-USING-JAVA
📘 Overview

The Internet Banking System is a console-based Java application that simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, login, deposit, withdrawal, fund transfer, and transaction history.
It demonstrates the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism using Core Java.

🎯 Project Objectives

Simulate real-world internet banking features.

Demonstrate core OOPs principles.

Implement a simple backend using Java Collections (HashMap).

Allow users to perform multiple banking transactions securely.

Develop clean, modular, and easy-to-understand code.
